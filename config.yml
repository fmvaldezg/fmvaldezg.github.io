    description: "I am a Geographer interested on urban and economic geography in Latin America. After having worked for the National Planning Secretariat for 3 years I obtained a grant to study a masters degree in geography of developing countries in France at the Universite Paris 1. Since then I have been interested in teaching geography in higher education as well as doing research in spatial analysis for urban development. Former Vice-president of the Asociacion Geografica del Ecuador, I am deeply committed to develop geographic studies in any education level in Ecuador. Right now I am studying my PhD in Geography at the Northern Illinois University. My current research is on residential preferences and behavior in South American cities and spatial variation of housing prices."
