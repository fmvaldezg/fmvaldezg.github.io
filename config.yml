Dedicated to the application of Geographic Information Systems and open geospatial data to develop urban planning solutions for sustainable futures based on collective action.<br><br>I have worked in public institutions at the national level in Ecuador, for 10 years as a professor and researcher in undergraduate and graduate programs in Ecuador, and as a consultant on projects.
