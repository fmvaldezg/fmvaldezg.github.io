      <description>This paper discusses a service-learning course that used community geography to evaluate a proposed research and community center in DeKalb, IL. As students engaged with both university and local communities, we discovered shared concerns and interests, leading to collaborative analysis and recommendations. The project highlights the effectiveness of community geography in fostering meaningful discussions and addressing shared issues, offering insights for future town-gown relationship studies.</description>
